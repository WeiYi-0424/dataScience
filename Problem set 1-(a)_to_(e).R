#Relative to the average courses, rating of the instructor's physical appearance increases by 1, the course overall teaching evaluation score increases by 0.133.

#####part(e)#####
#It is important to include a constant in the above regressions, because the constant means the eval score when the beauty is 0.
#Also there exists negative beauty value, without constant term, the eval score will also be negative and it will increase the residual.
